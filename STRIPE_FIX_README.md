# Stripe Payment Issue Fix

## Problem
The payment page was showing "Payment system is not ready. Please refresh the page and try again." error because the Stripe publishable key was not configured.

## Solution
I've implemented the following fixes:

### 1. Enhanced Stripe Configuration (`src/config/stripe.js`)
- Added fallback for missing environment variable
- Added validation functions for Stripe keys
- Added configuration status checking

### 2. Improved Error Handling (`src/pages/StripePaymentPage.jsx`)
- Better error messages with specific guidance
- Configuration status indicators
- Development mode warnings
- Step-by-step setup instructions

### 3. User Experience Improvements
- Clear warning when Stripe is not configured
- Test mode indicator when using test keys
- Helpful links to Stripe dashboard
- Detailed setup instructions

## How to Fix the Issue

### Step 1: Get Your Stripe Key
1. Go to [Stripe Dashboard](https://dashboard.stripe.com/apikeys)
2. Copy your **publishable key** (starts with `pk_test_` for test mode)
3. Keep this key handy for the next step

### Step 2: Set up Environment Variable
1. Create a `.env` file in your project root (same level as package.json)
2. Add your Stripe publishable key:
   ```
   VITE_STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=pk_test_your_actual_key_here
   ```
3. Replace `pk_test_your_actual_key_here` with your actual key from Step 1
4. Save the file
5. Restart your development server (`npm run dev` or `yarn dev`)

### Step 3: Verify the Fix
- The yellow warning banner should disappear
- You should see a blue "Test Mode" indicator (if using test keys)
- The payment form should load properly

## Test Cards for Development
- **Visa**: `4242424242424242`
- **Mastercard**: `5555555555554444`
- **Declined**: `4000000000000002`

## Features Added
- ✅ Configuration validation
- ✅ Better error messages
- ✅ Setup guidance
- ✅ Test mode indicators
- ✅ Fallback handling
- ✅ User-friendly interface

The payment system should now work properly once you configure your Stripe publishable key!
