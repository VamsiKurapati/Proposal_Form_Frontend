# Stripe Payment Issue Fix

## Problem
The payment page was showing "Payment system is not ready. Please refresh the page and try again." error because the Stripe publishable key was not configured.

## Solution
I've implemented the following fixes:

### 1. Enhanced Stripe Configuration (`src/config/stripe.js`)
- Added fallback for missing environment variable
- Added validation functions for Stripe keys
- Added configuration status checking

### 2. Improved Error Handling (`src/pages/StripePaymentPage.jsx`)
- Better error messages with specific guidance
- Configuration status indicators
- Development mode warnings
- Step-by-step setup instructions

### 3. User Experience Improvements
- Clear warning when Stripe is not configured
- Test mode indicator when using test keys
- Helpful links to Stripe dashboard
- Detailed setup instructions

## How to Fix the Issue

### Option 1: Set up Environment Variable (Recommended)
1. Create a `.env` file in your project root
2. Add your Stripe publishable key:
   ```
   VITE_STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=pk_test_your_actual_key_here
   ```
3. Restart your development server

### Option 2: Get Your Stripe Key
1. Go to [Stripe Dashboard](https://dashboard.stripe.com/apikeys)
2. Copy your publishable key (starts with `pk_test_` for test mode)
3. Follow Option 1 above

### Option 3: Use Test Key (Temporary)
The system now has a fallback test key, but you should replace it with your actual key for proper functionality.

## Test Cards for Development
- **Visa**: `4242424242424242`
- **Mastercard**: `5555555555554444`
- **Declined**: `4000000000000002`

## Features Added
- ✅ Configuration validation
- ✅ Better error messages
- ✅ Setup guidance
- ✅ Test mode indicators
- ✅ Fallback handling
- ✅ User-friendly interface

The payment system should now work properly once you configure your Stripe publishable key!
